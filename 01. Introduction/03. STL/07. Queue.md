# Queue

It is similar to stack but follows a **FIFO (First In First Out)**.

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    queue<int> queue;

    queue.push(5);
    queue.emplace(10);
    queue.push(8);

    cout << "Front is -> " << queue.front() << endl;
    cout << "Back is -> " << queue.back() << endl;
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
Front is -> 5
Back is -> 8
```

So it is basically a stack but in reverse.

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    queue<int> queue;

    queue.push(5);
    queue.emplace(10);
    queue.push(8);

    cout << "Front is -> " << queue.front() << endl;
    cout << "Back is -> " << queue.back() << endl;

    queue.pop();
    cout << "New front is -> " << queue.front() << endl;
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
Front is -> 5
Back is -> 8
New front is -> 10
```
