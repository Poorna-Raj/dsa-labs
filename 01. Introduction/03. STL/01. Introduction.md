# STL (Standard Template Library)

STL is a collection of pre-built classes and functions that make it easy to manage data using common data structures like vectors, stacks, and maps. It saves time and effort by providing ready-to-use, efficient algorithms and containers.

Every base c++ program follows a unique pattern. This patter is called the [skeleton of a c++ program](../01.%20C++/01.%20Skeleton%20of%20C++.md).

STL is divided into 4 parts,

1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Functions
4. Iterators
