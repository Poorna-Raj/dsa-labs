# Prime Numbers

Prime number is a number with **exactly** 2 factors, which are `1` and `itself`.

For example,

- `11` is a prime number because it is divisible by `1` and `11`.
- `4` is not a prime number because it is divisible by `1`,`2`,`4`.

## Brute force Method

`input.txt`

```txt
5
```

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= x; i++)
    {
        if (x % i == 0)
        {
            count++;
        }
    }

    if (count != 2)
    {
        cout << x << " is not a prime number." << "\n";
    }
    else
    {
        cout << x << " is a prime number." << "\n";
    }
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
5 is not a prime number.
```

Time Complexity = O(N).

## Observed Approach

This is done by using the observed method of printing all divisions.

`input.txt`

```txt
5
```

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    int count = 0;

    for (int i = 1; i * i <= x; i++)
    {
        if (x % i == 0)
        {
            count++;

            if ((x / i) != i)
            {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    if (count != 2)
    {
        cout << x << " is not a prime number." << "\n";
    }
    else
    {
        cout << x << " is a prime number." << "\n";
    }
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
5 is not a prime number.
```

Time Complexity = $O(\sqrt{n})$.
