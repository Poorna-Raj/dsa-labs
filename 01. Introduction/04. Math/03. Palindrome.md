# Palindrome

Palindrome are the **numbers for which Reverse is exactly same as the original one**.

For Example,

1. `121` is considered as a palindrome because the reverse of the number also displayed as `121`.
2. `3` is also considered as a palindrome number.
3. `154` is **not** considered as a palindrome number because the revers of that number is `451` != `154`.

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x, y, reverse;
    cin >> x;
    y = abs(x);
    reverse = 0;

    while (y > 0)
    {
        reverse = (reverse * 10) + y % 10;
        y /= 10;
    }

    if (reverse == x)
    {
        cout << "x is a palindrome number.";
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "x is not a palindrome number";
    }
}
