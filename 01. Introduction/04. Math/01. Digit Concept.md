# Digit Concept

## Extraction of Digits

This is about extracting numbers individually from a number.

For example:

```txt
We have a number of 7789. The goal is to take 9 first 8 second 7 third and 7 fourth.
```

We can do that using `modulus operator (%)`.

`input.txt`

```txt
7789
```

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x, y;
    cin >> x;
    y = x;

    while (y > 0)
    {
        cout << y % 10 << endl;
        y /= 10;
    }
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
9
8
7
7
```

## Question

Find how many digit does a number contains.

`input.txt`

```txt
-7789
```

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x, y;
    int count = 0;
    cin >> x;
    y = abs(x);

    while (y > 0)
    {
        count++;
        y /= 10;
    }

    cout << "Number of digits in " << x << " is " << count << "\n";
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
Number of digits in -7789 is 4
```

Another method is by using **logarithms**.

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x, y;
    cin >> x;
    y = abs(x);

    int count = log10(y) + 1;

    cout << "Number of digits in " << x << " is " << count << "\n";
}
```

Time Complexity - $O(\log_{10} (N))$
