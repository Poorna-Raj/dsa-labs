# Skeleton of C++

Inorder to write a c++ code, we have to follow a specific structure. This structure is common to all the c++ codes.

`demo.cpp`

```c
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

1. `#include <iostream>`
   This is a standard library which we you to take inputs and produce outputs. There are many libraries which provides different functionalities.

2. `int main(){return 0;}`
   This is the main function, which is the entry point to the codebase. `int` is the return type of the function and we usually return 0 when there is no issue. If there is a issue the system will return another value.

## Printing "Hello World"

`demo.cpp`

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World" << "\n";
    std::cout << "Hello World";
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
Hello World
Hello World
```

## Taking an Input

`input.txt`

```txt
13
```

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    cout << x << "\n";
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
13
```

### Taking more than one input

`input.txt`

```txt
13
16
```

`demo.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    cout << "The value of x = " << x << " and y = " << y << "\n";
}
```

`output.txt`

```txt
The value of x = 13 and y = 16
```
